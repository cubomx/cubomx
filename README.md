I'm on my way of getting my career into the Frontend path. Anything that you may know about it and want to share it, please tell me. I want to know what other things are
out there. 

My learning goals for this 2021 are:
- Improve my React.js skills by inmersing myself in Hooks, React Router & Redux and Webpack.
- Get a more in depth learning of CSS and Flexbox (learning the hard way with React Native).
- Some deployment tools (maybe Heroku, Vercel or Google Firebase). 
- Continue to improve my React Native skills.
- Finally, also learn Flutter for mobile development.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a <strong>React Native</strong> app that wants to encourage people to learn Sign Language and break anything that keeps apart others. The name of
the app is Waves. You can find in: [Waves](https://github.com/cubomx/waves). If you are interested in join in, let me know :) 

ðŸŒ± Well, Iâ€™m currently learning React Native for the project I'm working on. I had started a course to fully get the concepts but, we need to get the project to start its development as quickly as possible. So, I'm in a hurry to building the first stones of this huge and exciting app.

âš¡ In other things not related to computing, I like to do the next things:
- Play soccer.
- Read books.
- Write whatever comes to my mind.
- Play Boardgames.
- Listen to my friends and trying to be the best I can in comprenhend their feelings.
